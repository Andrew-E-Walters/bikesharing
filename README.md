## Overview of Statistical Analysis


## Results

### Trip Durations

In this graph we can see the number of bikes compared to the length of the trip. Most trips durations are within the sub 30 mins range and it starts to signifigantly trail off after the 40 minute mark. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Trip Durations by Gender

Using the same metrics as before, we have now created a graph that shows the duration of trips over time broken out by gender. The Gender Groupings are Female, Male, and Unkown as shown by the key in the right hand side. The highest number of bike rides occur within the first few minutes of the trip duration. Min 5 For Male, 7 For Female, and 11 for Unknown.

### Trips by Weekday Hour

In this visualization we are looking at a heatmap of trips over the course of the weekdays by hour. The Darker the highlight the higher the frequency. 8am on Weekdays, and 5-7pm on Weekdays consitently have the highest frequency. Highest Frequency is Thursday at 5pm.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)

This heatmap is breaking out the data into the 3 Gender Groupings discussed before. Frequency still seems to be simillar for Male and Female at 6pm on Thursday, with  those labeled under unknown have the highest frequency on Saturday at 11 am.

### Trips by Gender by Weekday

This Heatmap not only looks at the frequency by Gender but also by Usertype. Subscribers have a higher frequency with a large portion of them on Thursday using the Citibike. It seems that the highest use for all genders who are subscribers is on Thursdays, while for Customers it is on Saturday.

## From Module 
### Gender
![](https://github.com/Andrew-E-Walters/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/Gender.png)

This is a simple pie chart but an important one. It gives the gender groupings and the proportion of the sample population that they are. This will help our other analysis to give some perspective on not only when people use the service, but who uses the service. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Top Starting Locations

This is a graph that details the most used starting locations of the Citi Bikes. The larger the cirle the higher the number of people who start at the station. This can help the company in determining where they should be sure to stock up on bikes so there is not a shortage in certian areas.
